This is a simple login page project that demonstrates the integration of Material-UI for styling and uses dummy JSON data for authentication. The login page allows users to enter their username and password and verifies the credentials against the predefined authentication details.

## Getting Started

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory using the terminal/command prompt.
3. Install the dependencies using npm:

```
npm install
```

4. Start the development server:

```
npm start
```

The project will be running at http://localhost:3000.

## Authentication Details

To log in to the application, you can use the following authentication details:

- Username: kminchelle
- Password: 0lelplR

Please note that this is a sample login page, and the authentication is only for demonstration purposes using dummy data. In a real-world application, you would replace this authentication mechanism with a secure server-side authentication process.
